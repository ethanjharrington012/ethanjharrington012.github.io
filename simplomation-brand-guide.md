# Simplomation Brand Guide

## 1. Brand Essence
**Purpose:** Simplomation simplifies business life by automating follow-ups, quotes, and scheduling with tools you already use.  
**Tagline:** *Automation that works quietly in the background — just like your best employee.*

---

## 2. Logo & Favicon
- **Primary Logo:** Use your full Simplomation logo (SVG) for headers and place it in the top-left.  
- **Favicon/Submark:** A simplified “S” icon—use as favicon and small-scale applications.  
- **Clear Space:** Leave at least 1× the height of the “S” around the logo on all sides.  
- **Do Not:** Stretch, rotate, recolor, or distort the logo in any way.

## 4. Typography

- **Font:** Inter (already in use)
- **Usage Guidelines:**
  - **Headings:** Use bold weights
  - **Body Text:** Regular weight
  - **Hierarchy:** Maintain consistent sizing (e.g., H1 > H2 > H3 > Paragraph)
- **Guideline:** Keep line heights readable—1.4×–1.6× font size

---

## 5. Voice & Tone

**Voice:** Friendly, plain-spoken, confident  
**Tone:** Supportive, practical, simple  

**Do Use:**
- “We help you connect your tools… so every lead is followed up without lifting a finger.”
- “Save hours. Keep every customer.”

**Don’t Use:**
- Technical jargon like “CRM onboarding,” “SaaS integration,” or “workflow automation.” — Unless you’re explaining it clearly.

---

## 6. Imagery & Icons

- **Style:** Real photos or simple vector illustrations that show tradespeople—like an arborist with tools, contractor with clipboard.
- **Feel:** Bright, real, human.
- **Icon Use:** Use clean, minimal icons (e.g., calendar, envelope, clipboard).

---

## 7. Content Examples

- **Headline Example:**  
  **Less paperwork. More paying work.**

- **Mini Case:**  
  > *We helped a local arborist connect QuickBooks to their CRM—new leads are automatically followed up. No more missed jobs, no extra work.*
